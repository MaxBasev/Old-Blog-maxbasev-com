Hello, everybody. I decided to write another post here but with a little thought about the topic, what to write about? Where can I get the theme for the post? What if there’s nothing to write about? Let’s think about it.

I have been taking a course on Storytelling from one portal for a long time (they had a sale for 700 rubles, I got it, I thought maybe something good would happen, but it turned out to be very bad) and there is a similar topic – “How to find a theme for history”. I will not write here all that banal that in that lesson is written, suddenly the owners of the portal will be offended and for violation of rights will block me. But they write about this idea from Annette Simmons’ book “Storitelling”:

- Plots “Who I am”
- Plots “What I am doing here”
- Plots “Perspective”
- Plots “Values”
- Plots “I read your mind”

Well, it’s a nightmare, really.=) Ready-made structures for various quacks. “Hello! I’m Misha Ivanov, founder of blah, blah, blah. I’ve come to give you blah, blah, blah, blah. You’ll get blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.”
It’s just trash.

Okay, well, that’s more of a question for Annette Simmons with her “super new ideas” than for the portal, they have the opposite idea of “hunting for history”. But what if I have an absolutely boring life and can’t even write a post on Instagram (there’s nothing interesting)? We are looking for stories around us!

That’s how I was sitting, looking for a story, thinking about a review of books, because last week I read 3 books, and did not display in the blog, but no – another time. I decided to “hunt” more, and as a result I got this text. What’s it about? Well, it’s about the text… The text about the text, yeah… It’s about the fact that you can write a text (even if it doesn’t suck) with absolutely any idea/topic or even with its absence.

Come on, let’s take the situation that the topic “What to write about?” about texts is not suitable for your “Instagram account” at all. Hmm, what did I do this morning? I got up at 5, did a stretch for 45 minutes = at least three topics: the benefit of waking up at 5 am (or a feeling of superiority over others _evil laugh_), a post about stretching (I even wrote about it and habits once in my Russian blog) just about exercise or post about discipline / habits / motivation / health. Here is the story: “I got up today at 5 am, myself and without an alarm clock! Then I drank a glass of water, meditated for 5 minutes and went to stretch. It was really cool!” Well, that’s something like storytelling.

No, no, no, it’s already happened, it’s got to be something else!

Okay, different. For example, I’ve also been writing for 10 minutes in the morning free (btw, this text is half free writing at the beginning), and then, about 2-3 times a week, during the day I write by the minute, which I do, for example:

“10:08 – still drinking coffee. The background is “The Silence of the Lambs” – a fantastic movie, actually.
10:20 – my wife went to the post office and the shop, and I went back to work. Now the blog post is next, I’ll try…”

You can write about the benefits of free writing for the brain, but it’s again about texts, whatever, then about memory and how to stop forgetting everything (put your thoughts immediately in the phone / notebook / brain friend / wife). Again, you can write a lot of things about the movies, and even more so about the “The Silence of the Lambs”)).

As a result, what to write about is not a problem at all, even if you are absolutely just lying on the sofa and looking at the ceiling, then write about the sofa with a conclusion to something else:
“Oh, man, my couch is fine, but I saw great things in Ikea a couple of years ago! I should have taken it, but now it’s gone… Conclusion? You see the good thing – take it right away! Or, in other words, don’t miss your chance!”

Well, that’s how it works. Maybe it’s good for someone.=)
