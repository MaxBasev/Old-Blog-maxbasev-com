## Hi there!👋

### My name is Max and I am from Russia, or rather from the coldest part of this country - Siberia.

🤦‍♂️ I usually write that I am a professional bankrupt and have already failed 3 businesses... Now I sit at home and try to do freelance (although I think that many people now do the same 😷).I live in Novosibirsk, but I dream about Canada. Although I was born in the Moscow region.

#### Briefly some facts about me:

- 📃 In spring I try to start "life from scratch". So far, it is not working out very well.
- 🎓 Studying programming languages such as JS, Python, and PHP. And I do different projects on them. It turns out to be bad, but I sometimes even get paid for it...
- 🖋 I try to start speaking English, so sometimes I start a blog in English - maxbasev.com. It turns out bad so far, but I don't give up.
- 😳 I created a Patreon account for my online diary. To overcome my shyness and defeat my inner introvert.
- ☕️ I drink a lot of coffee and adore any horror movies and Lovecraft stories. 😱
- 💡 I always want to "learn everything", but in the end, there is not enough time for anything and I am stupidly playing online games.
- 🚀 I launch different projects, sometimes successful, sometimes not. Although on the first line of this text I think it is clear which projects are more...
- 📚 I read a lot (150+ books the year before last), now I try to be more selective.

#### And quite briefly about me:
- 🍺 I have not been drinking alcohol for 10 years...
- 🚬 I also do not smoke or use drugs.
- 🍰 I do not eat sugar and salt.
- 😇 I do not believe in God, but I believe in brains.

I will be happy to socialize and make new friends.

##### P.S. Coffee - the drink of the gods!
