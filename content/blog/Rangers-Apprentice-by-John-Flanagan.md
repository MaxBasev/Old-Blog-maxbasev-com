Tuesday will be the day of books. So a little feedback on what I read last week. And I read, or rather listened to it in the audio version, the first four books from Ranger’s Apprentice series by John Flanagan. To start with, as usual, from the [author’s website](http://www.worldofjohnflanagan.com/books/the-ruins-of-gorlan/) I will put out a description, so that you do not go back and forth.

> They have always scared him in the past-the Rangers, with their dark cloaks and shadowy ways. The villagers believe the Rangers practice magic that makes them invisible to ordinary people. And now 15-year-old Will, always small for his age, has been chosen as a Ranger’s apprentice. What he doesn’t yet realize is that the Rangers are the protectors of the kingdom. Highly trained in the skills of battle and surveillance, they fight the battles before the battles reach the people. And as Will is about to learn, there is a large battle brewing. The exiled Morgarath, Lord of the Mountains of Rain and Night, is gathering his forces for an attack on the kingdom. This time, he will not be denied. . . .

I will say right away that if you are waiting for something like Game of Thrones, do not even try to read this book, because it is written for teenagers. Therefore, not a word about sex, any violent murders, etc. is not there. At least in the first four books of the series. I will tell you right away that even though I am 29 – I liked the book, but it is a simple absolutely not stressful reading in which you know in advance that the good will win and the bad will be punished.

As one reader said and I fully agree with him, in general, if you think about it, in the Middle Ages, the concept of “childhood” did not exist. “Childhood” is an invention of the New Age. In the old days, children were considered inferior adults and were not allowed to descend into anything. Small summers were not a privilege like now, but an aggravating factor.

This book is an encyclopedia of the harsh life of a medieval boy for modern teenagers, exhausted by idleness. John Flanagan’s novel is not a “rebellious” prose in the spirit of ‘The Catcher in the Rye’. It is a book of a completely different time, and the messages in it are completely different. As long as you are not old enough, you will be commanded, you will be offended, you will be burdened with work, and you will be constantly poked. No matter how hard you try, your mentor will not like you anyway. Therefore, squeak harder your teeth and do not forget to measure your height by the door jamb – with each new top will appreciate you more, take your words more seriously.

In the end: an extremely simplified “maturation process” novel for middle school age. The target audience will like the book. And for adults, it’s just a light reading for fun.
