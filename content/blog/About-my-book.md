![Post about my book](../../images/uploads/003-Post-Book.png "Post about my book")

## I was already writing a book.

Yeah, it was really more of a textbook or even a manual, but it was published. Even in Amazon you can still find it, but the name under which I wrote it I won’t tell you. =p Although if you want to find it, you can find it without problems. =)

In my last post, I already told you about the book in brief. In this post, I want to tell you more. So if you’re interested, read on. =)

## What’s the book about?

Originally, I wanted to do a translation of my last book. Then I watched the news and realized that a lot had changed and the old information was very outdated.

So my first step is to update the information and rewrite everything that has changed.

The main theme of the book is working in Telegram messenger, maintaining and promoting channels. And as a result – earning money on your channels.

I will also write not only about advertising, but also about the content itself, because they say “Content is King” not in vain.

## What’s the book for?

The most important thing is to develop your own English language skills. Since I am determined to move to Canada, my main language will change over time, and I can’t live without writing and blogging.) This blog was created for the same purpose, by the way.

The second reason is money. We live in a capitalist world and make a little money on our own hobby seems like a good idea to me. What do you think about it?

For the second reason, I started looking for options for publishing my book. Everyone writes that they’re not paying for the book, but for the author. As I understand it, for his name. I mean, you should be popular by now and then maybe your book will be published. It’s pretty sad, but I’ll be looking for options next =)

I thought I wrote a lot, but it turns out I didn’t. It’s really hard to write in English…
