Hey, everybody. It’s been a week since my last post. So it’s time for a new one. Here we go!

I’ve been sketching out a little plan for this message. So let’s go over the items.

## Why do I want to move abroad?

I already wrote about it, so very briefly.

- The laws in my country are not enforced,
- Criminals,
- Low standard of living,
- Corruption is thriving,
- The weather’s so bad.

The reason I still haven’t left is because of certain debts and responsibilities. Not all my business ideas have been successful and there’s quite a lot of credit accumulated. Before I leave, I have to pay them off, which is about $100,000. Yes, I have to work very hard, given our salaries… =DDD

## Why Canada, exactly?

According to all the photos and videos, it’s just amazing nature and views. (Someday I’ll tell you about the value of a beautiful view from the window for me and my productivity.) It’s a country of law, and it’s also pretty safe there, you know, compared to Russia. In fact, Canada seems to me to be the best version of Russia, the version that Russia will never be.

## What can I do?

And it’s true. I don’t think that my knowledge (quite specific) will be in demand anywhere except Russia. Web development, setting up advertising and promotion on the Internet… Millions of people can do it and do it better than me. >\_< So get a work visa from, say, Google does not shine for me.

## What am I studying?

That’s why, besides English, I plan to start studying Data Science. The future is behind this direction!
Maybe I should make a portfolio with my work in English? Except there are no works, because I did everything only for Russia.
Anyway, I’ll do something like that in the end. I think it will help me when I move when I look for work.

Does anybody have any ideas about that?=))

## My target

It’s as simple as that. I just want to make the world a better place. =) I want scientific and technological progress. I want to end all wars and deaths.
And I also want to make my own computer game. =D

P.S. With these ideas in my country, I look like an idiot.

You know, this message sounds like a complaint, but I tried really hard to make it not. It’s just that if you’re having a hard time in your life, you know, there are people in the world who are much harder. And those who have $100,000 in debt =DDD.
When it’s hard for me, I always think about life in Africa or Venezuela.
