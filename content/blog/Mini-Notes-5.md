Almost a whole month has passed since my last record. Unfortunately, I’m too busy with work to fully run my blog, but everything will get better soon!
Yes, I know I’ve been saying this for 3 months now…
Well, now some notes and my thoughts.

## Playing with my wife in Hearthstone

Yeah, sometimes we play, or rather every day, but not much.

## I have seen a lot of new horrors.

Reviews will be available soon.)
