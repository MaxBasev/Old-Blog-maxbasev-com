You know, I wanted to do a post about my daily routine. And generally about the benefits of that very routine, but I decided to google it, and what they write about it on the Internet. And I found this great article.

So I don’t think it makes much sense to write anew about “what is daily routine”. But I will tell you how I use it, what it includes, and in general what the benefits and results.

## How did it start for me?

For me it all started with “The Miracle Morning: The Not-So-Obvious Secret Guaranteed to Transform Your Life (Before 8AM)” by Hal Elrod.

Yeah, I know a lot of people say that his book is slag, but there is an opposite opinion – mine.=)

About my daily routines
The idea of getting up at 5 a.m. is not new to me, and I’ve had periods before when I got up. For example, for jogging or to play on the computer (you don’t have to do that, it’s not the reason to wake up early), etc. However, the book does not just say “Wake up at five in the morning!” No, it describes many useful morning habits that eventually turn into a daily morning routine.

The first morning after reading the book, I jumped right out of bed. The mood was very positive and I thought I would do everything I wanted to do in a week in one day. Spoiler: I was right.=)

## What was points of my morning routine?

Consistency is important, of course, but it is not critical if some parts change places.

- The first point was weighting. Yes, I hadn’t given up hope of gaining muscle mass at the time. So I figured I could use some control over my weight.
- Wash and brush my teeth. Well, that’s what I think everyone does.
- Make the exercise vacuum. A few repetitions of 30-40 seconds.
- Drink a glass of water. Water is life.
- Five minutes of meditation. Well, let’s just say I didn’t really believe in it all, but I decided to try it. I didn’t notice any special results…
- Affirmations. To say various personal motivational phrases. You can read more about affirmations somewhere on the Internet, I’ll tell you that I didn’t believe in them, but I decided to try it. Yeah, I’m still in debt and in Russia, do the affirmations work?
- Visualization. Like the last point, it’s not difficult for me to see pictures of places I would like to live or visit. It’s not much practical use.
- Five minutes on the diary entry. This habit is still with me.
- Stretching for 30 to 45 minutes. Full stretching of all muscles in the body. Strength in the morning is a waste of energy, quite enough stretching or yoga complex.
- Reading. I was lucky with my wife, after stretching, she went to make breakfast, and I sat down to read. Usually I could read about 25-30 pages.

That’s 10 points I had every morning in my routine. And then something went wrong.

## It’s over. Am I lazy? Am I tired? Am I bored?

Above, I described an example of my perfect morning. That scheme of routine I followed for about 3 months without missing a single day, but then somehow stopped. Now I can barely remember why. I think I got a little sick, my schedule was off and it never recovered. And then the virus came and they locked us all up in their apartments. Being indoors all the time without being able to get out is also one of the reasons for the recession.

At this point, my routine looks like this:

- Wake up, wash up, brush your teeth
- Eat
- Brew coffee
- While drinking coffee – write down your thoughts in your diary, do a lesson at Duolingo. (Plus now Patreon)
- Play a game of online chess
- Answer letters to Slowly
- Get to work

Yeah, it’s a little different from what I was aiming for, but I think I’ll soon go back to the old (better) version of the routine and combine it with the current one.

## Does it make sense?

The strength of the routine I was convinced by the stretching. I really saw the progress! In addition, it is an activity where progress is quite easy to measure, unlike affirmations of the same. So if you are hesitant, start with something that you can accurately measure without any effort. And when you see the result, I guarantee you – you will catch on fire to add more and more items to your routine.
