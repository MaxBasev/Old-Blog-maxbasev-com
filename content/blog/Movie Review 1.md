So, I wanted to write this post long ago, last week. A post about the films I’ve recently seen, but last week I didn’t have time to do it, but there’s a lot more to write about.

## So, right to the point, the first film is #Alive.
First, as usual, I will put out a story that I will borrow from IMDB.

The rapid spread of an unknown infection has left an entire city in ungovernable chaos, but one survivor remains alive in isolation. It is his story.

I have already written a short review on my Facebook,

“The movie is quite interesting and in a way reminds me of the manga “I Am a Hero”. I think I would act like the main character, I would also lock myself in a room and suffer (playing PC)…
The movie should be 16+, there’s zombies, there’s blood, violence and attempts to scare different screamers. In general, for fans of the zombie apocalypse genre is a very good film.”

I will add a few more words.
A week later, I can say that the film certainly does not reach Romero’s masterpieces, and whether I would lie to watch it as many times as they do, but it is quite possible that I will watch it a couple more times as a background movie while working.

## Second film – Train to Busan 2: Peninsula
“Sequel to the 2016 South Korean zombie film Train to Busan”.

IMDB
What is it really?
And now this is a disappointment. The second film is WHAT is worse than the first, just a terrible bad film. If you are waiting for a movie of the first part level, forget it! The creators tried to mix everything you can, but you just had to make a good movie, without trying to add there super large-scale battles (as they thought) or references to Mad Max… The plot is banal, the graphics is horrible, cinema is bad. You can watch only once, when there’s nothing to do and then only in memory of the first part.

## The third movie is Ready or Not
“A bride’s wedding night takes a sinister turn when her eccentric new in-laws force her to take part in a terrifying game.”

IMDB
Funny, but I liked this film more than the previous one… Yeah, it’s stupid, trivial and in general it’s a trash, but that’s the beauty of it. You can watch it both in the background and on purpose “without breaking off”.

## And the last movie is Enola Holmes
“When Enola Holmes-Sherlock’s teen sister-discovers her mother missing, she sets off to find her, becoming a super-sleuth in her own right as she outwits her famous brother and unravels a dangerous conspiracy around a mysterious young Lord.”

IMDB
Terrible movie. Just a terrible movie! I don’t advise anyone to watch this nonsense and I don’t understand why it has such high ratings. A girl teenager alone deals with adult men, quietly gets up after her adult uncle kicks her foot in the solar plexus, and also turns out to be smarter than his older brother Sherlock Holmes?! Are you serious?! Please, do not develop such a trash ever again! And I do not advise anyone to watch this, they twisted the very idea of the great detective Sherlock Holmes!

Well, somehow I can say about films in the end. In the future I will probably write more if I write about something, or maybe even do separate posts about separate films or anime, but so far, unfortunately, no candidates for it.
