A new post with reviews of the films I‚Äôve seen in recent days.

Previous part here.

## Apostle

In 1905, a drifter on a dangerous mission to rescue his kidnapped sister tangles with a sinister religious cult on an isolated island.

IMDB
I already started watching this film about a year ago, but then I watched it with my wife, and she hates horror movies. In the end, we never saw the film, because ‚Äúsca-a-ared!‚Äù üôÇ Well, okay, but now I watched it myself and will say that it was worth it!

The plot, though not very original, but something reminded me of Shyamalan movies. Also, as you think, I like horror movies and especially about the period 1800-1940. All the horror lovers should definitely watch it, but for those who don‚Äôt like horrors, I still advise to watch it at least once.

## It Follows

A young woman is followed by an unknown supernatural force after a sexual encounter.

IMDB
I‚Äôve seen this film before, and last week I reviewed it for the fourth time, it seems. Yes, it is horror again.
It‚Äôs a movie for amateurs, but for some reason I liked it very much (yes, well, logically, not every movie I will review 4-5 times).
The plot is simple, as in most horror movies ‚Äì a few young people will be killed by something scary and incomprehensible.

There is a mixture of Final Destination, Candyman and a number of other horror movies.
I advise to see the fans of the genre. I think the others won‚Äôt like it.

## Baskin

A squad of unsuspecting cops go through a trapdoor to Hell when they stumble upon a Black Mass in an abandoned building.

IMDB
One more film that I reviewed.
Turkish horror! To be honest, it‚Äôs just trash, but for the background movie is great. Since it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve watched it while working on all kinds of boring and routine tasks, which require minimum thinking, I even liked the movie.
As a result, it‚Äôs a good film for the background so as not to strain your brains or distract you from your work.

As you understand, I watch mostly horror movies, and all other films and anime ‚Äì I watch with my wife. And considering that the time in recent weeks is quite short, I can only watch in the background, something like the films I wrote above.
Next week I will probably get more interesting reviews for the films.
