## Part 1. What am I talking about?

Have you ever said anything stupid and then been embarrassed? Anyway, I’ve had it. Did you remember those moments a year later? Or two years later? Or even ten years? Why does that happen?
I don’t know about you, but I’ve had it a few times. They say, “Modesty adorns a man,” I’m not sure. I don’t think modesty is the only thing that gets in the way. Modesty and shame are not synonymous, but one follows the other.

It’s probably the country I live in. We have the most impudent and immodest people who succeed simply because they step on people and they don’t care about moral and social principles. And I was brought up differently. What am I supposed to do now?!

A humble, boring, grey man is 100% about me.

## Part 2. Is it bad to be an introvert?

I would say definitely, yes. Let’s find out what Wikipedia thinks about this.

> The traits of extraversion (or extroversion) and introversion are a central dimension in some human personality theories. The terms introversion and extraversion were popularized by Carl Jung, although both the popular understanding and psychological usage differ from his original intent. Extraversion tends to be manifested in outgoing, talkative, energetic behavior, whereas introversion is manifested in more reserved and solitary behavior. Rather than focusing on interpersonal behavior, however, Jung defined introversion as an “attitude-type characterised by orientation in life through subjective psychic contents”, and extraversion as “an attitude-type characterised by concentration of interest on the external object”.

In short, nothing good.

Damn, how do people communicate? I mean, not on the Internet, but in person. Sitting in a coffee shop and talking. If I’m sitting in a coffee shop with somebody and it’s not a business meeting, I usually keep quiet and sometimes say something like “Yeah”, ” Yes”, “Mm-hmm”…

And you know what the problem is? It has a negative impact on learning English. Thank you for Slowly as I would hardly write to everyone in a row on Facebook or Twitter.
I already wrote here that I have been blogging in Russian for a long time. Under an alias. I didn’t use my real name on the Internet until recently. Even if I didn’t use a name and photo on my Russian blog. I think it’s clear how introverted I am.
So that’s about English. I don’t know how to communicate with people at all, and in a foreign language it’s a nightmare. Then how do you learn to communicate? Learn to pronunciate and everything…

How can I fix this? Well, let’s start by being honest not only with yourself, but also with your audience. Writing the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It must be psychology. To accept yourself for who you are?
Well, in that case, I declare that everything I’ve written here before and what I’ll write in the future is 100% true. And let me be ashamed.

## Part 3. What else?

I’ve been asked by some in personal conversations. “Do you keep a diary? What do you mean? I mean, it’s already outdated.”
So I’ve decided that I’ll keep the diary not only in Russian, but also in English. Why not use the Patreon platform for that? Don’t worry, it’ll all be free.)
I must defeat modesty, and at the same time it is an additional practice of English.

Who knows, maybe I’ll grow up to podcasts one day and live communication is not far away.
